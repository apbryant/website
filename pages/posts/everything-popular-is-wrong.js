        <h2>Everything popular is wrong</h2>
        <h3>17 May 2020</h3>
        <p>“Everything popular is wrong.” -Oscar Wilde</p>

<p>I read this quote years ago in The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss. I didn’t get it then, but it’s meaning has become more apparent to me.</p>

<p>Most people don’t exercise.</p>

<p>Most people eat unhealthy food.</p>

<p>Most people don’t read books.</p>

<p>Most people don’t save.</p>

<p>Most people don’t invest.</p>

<p>Most people don’t have valuable skills.</p>

<p>Most people don’t know themselves.</p>

<p>Most people are reactionary.</p>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p>In order to avoid a lot of problems in life, do the opposite of what most people do.</p>
