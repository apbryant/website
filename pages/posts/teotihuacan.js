<p>I made this sketch thinking about Teotihuacan, an ancient city close to what's now Mexico City. I'd read about it in The Dawn of Everything and I wanted to make something inspired by the city's diagram in the book.</p> 
 
<p>In this sketch I create grids of squares. I split the canvas into a grid. Each grid cell can be further divided into its own grid until a maximum depth is reached. For each grid cell I decide whether to divide it further, or show a square in that grid cell's space.</p> 
 
<p>I choose between a range of random integers to decide how many cells a new grid should have. This offsets the grid lines, making the sketch a little more dynamic and less monotonous.</p> 
 
<p>The sketch uses black and gray. Because the cells have the same color, the join together into some neat shapes. It also reminded me of the stone ruins of a city lost to time.</p> 
 
<p>Here's a version with a red palette. The individual squares show more in this one.</p>
