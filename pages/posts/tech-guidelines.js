        <h2>Tech guidelines</h2>
        <h3>1 January 2020</h3>
        <p>Use the least amount of technology necessary to solve the problem.</p>

<p>I’ll quote Benjamin Hardy: “The amount of time you spend not looking at a screen reflects the quality of your actual life”.</p>

<p>Use technology primarily to create or automate, rather than to consume or correspond.</p>

<p>Don’t use technology to distract yourself.</p>

<p>Technology is a means to an end, not an end in itself.</p>

<p>Technology can help solve problems. It also creates new ones.</p>

<p>Technology doesn’t remove accountability.</p>

<p>If technology makes something cheaper, more of it will be done.</p>

<p>Technology has no morals.</p>

<p>Technology can’t make you happy.</p>
