        <h2>Overcoming travel objections</h2>
        <h3>Created 20 May 2018</h3>
        <h3>Updated 8 May 2021</h3>
        <p>Lots of people dream of travelling long term. The thought of lounging on a beach in Brazil or wandering through ancient villages in France set their hearts on fire. But for too many, those dreams remain just that. Dreams. They never turn them into reality because the “real world” entraps them. Jobs, bills, obligations, fears…they all keep people tied to their lives at home and scrolling through travel photos on Instagram instead of taking their own photos and making their own memories.</p>



<p>Here about some of the common objections people have to extended journeys abroad, and how those objections don’t carry as much weight as they initially.</p>



<h4>Money</h4>



<p>Inevitably someone will bring up the cost of travel, saying that it’s too expensive.</p>



<p>While travelling may not always be cheap, it doesn’t have to be expensive either. People think travel has to be expensive because the travel industry spends billions of dollars each year in marketing and advertising to make it seem that way.</p>



<p>You can make travel expensive if you stay at luxury hotels and eat at Michelin-star restaurants every day. But if you live like a local wherever you go, cooking your own food, living in an apartment or hostel, taking public transportation or biking, it is much more affordable.</p>



<p>Here’s the reality: In most of the world, the cost of living is less than it is in the United States. You can live well in a place with great weather, great food, and great culture for a fraction of what it costs to live in a bland, boring suburb in the United States.</p>



<h4>Time</h4>



<p>“Well, even if I had the money, how would I ever find time to travel? I have a job you know!”</p>



<p>There’s no law of nature saying that you have to work at a job for fifty weeks in turn for a sorry ten days of vacation a year.</p>



<p>In Santiago, Chile, where I live, I have met many remote employees, freelancers, and entrepreneurs making money from their laptops while they travelled long-term.</p>



<p>If your job consists of typing at a computer for eight hours a day, you can do your job from anywhere in the world. Some employers will let workers take sabbaticals, too. You could be one conversation with your boss away from freeing yourself from the confines of your office!</p>



<p>Also, if your job isn’t giving you the flexibility you want you can always, you know, quit. People less intelligent, skilled, and driven than you are have been quitting their jobs for centuries and have found other means to sustain themselves. You can too.</p>



<p>And since surveys show that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaviguppta/2017/03/08/gallup-american-workers-are-unengaged-and-looking-elsewhere/#1bb6b2663e8c">most Americans aren’t engaged at their jobs</a> you probably don’t like your job all that much anyway, so what’s the harm in walking away?</p>



<h4>FOMO</h4>



<p>A final major hurdle to long-term travel is the concern about being away from family and friends. They will share important milestones and fun nights out without you there to partake in them.</p>



<p>I told myself: “You know what? Life goes on. People have their lives, I have mine, and I have to live mine as I see fit.”</p>



<p>Your friends may drift away, but that’s a natural. How many of your friends from high school are you still friends with? People who were once close take different paths and drift apart. That’s fine. As you grow the people who will be in your life will change with you.</p>



<p>The same attitude generally applies to family, but there are some family members who you want to maintain contact with. The good thing about living in 2017 is that you can instantly communicate with anyone, no matter what part of the world you’re in. You don’t have to wait weeks for letters to get delivered, as was the case before modern communications. It’s very easy to establish a routine of contact with those you really care about in order to stay connected to them.</p>



<h4>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step</h4>



<p>The hardest part of extended travel is making the commitment to do it and taking the first step. That step could be buying plane tickets, having a conversation with your boss, or creating a budget. Once you make a decision to go, everything kind of falls into place. The challenges you’ll inevitably seem less daunting because you know that you’re going to see it through.</p>



<p>The benefits are totally worth it. Saving the money, making the commitment to do something big, pushing back against life, are parts of the process which make you a better person and give you skills which you can apply to other areas of your life. In addition to that, once you start your travels, travelling gives you even more benefits, like cultural awareness, language skills, new relationships, new professional skills, and a shitload of great memories.</p>



<p>So, what are you waiting for?</p>



<p>P.S. There two other common objections you may have: kids and safety. While I didn’t go into detail about these (I don’t have any kids after all) here are a <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/tips-for-taking-a-long-term-trip-with-kids/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d276da51">couple</a> <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/tips-for-traveling-in-dangerous-places/">articles</a> that address those topics to get you started.</p>
